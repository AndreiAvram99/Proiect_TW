        <h2><span>1. </span>Architectural pattern</h2>
        <p> This application uses the <b>MCV architectural style</b>. It was chosen because the application
            contains both interaction with the database and with users and in this way it is easy to
            split the view components from the rest of application. Also working with databases is
            separate from the the application functionalities. As a result all this components
            can be implemented individually by different people.</p>
        <p> The entire application is split in 4 components, which work individually as <b>microservices</b>.
        <p> <b>Microservices</b> allow the parallel development of all these components. Abstracts the operations
            that are done in the back, offering only the result. To use a microservices you don't need to
            know how it is implemented.</p>
        <p> The communication between these microservices respects the REST architecture using the
            operations: GET and POST. All data returned by them are in JSON format. This format was
            chosen because nowadays it is becoming more and more popular to the detriment of XML.</p>

    <section id="structure">
        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <p> The application is structured in 4 microservices depending on the functionalities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Data filter</li>
                <li>Data viewer</li>
                <li>Public API</li>
                <li>Data Administration</li>
            </ul>
        <section id="data_filter">
            <h3>Data filter</h3>
            <p> <b>Data filter</b> is the only component which has access to the events table form the database.
                Because this table can be very large, operations must be optimized as much as possible. This component
                has the role of extracting accidents according to different filters. This filters are sent as
                parameter in a GET request and the response to the events is returned in JSON format.</p>

        <section id="data_viewer">

        <section id="public_api">
            <h3>Public API</h3>
            <p> <b>Public API</b> component it is handling of requests from external applications and provides
                access to the data in the database by returning it in a structured way in the form of JSON.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="data_administration">
            <h3>Data Administration</h3>
            <p> <b>Data Administration</b> component allows authorized users to add events to the database.</p>
        </section>
    </section>
    <section id="database">
        <h2>Database</h2>
        <p> To store data was used MySQL, relational database management system, because it is suitable for
            large data and it is easy to do filtered queries according to many criteria.</p>
